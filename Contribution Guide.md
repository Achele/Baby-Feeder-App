# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **Baby Feeding Timer Project**. It's people like you that make Active Admin such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

# Kinds Of Contributions

**Baby Feeding Timer Project** is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from *design* or *logo design*, *features addition or advancement*, *submitting documentations* and *feature requests* or *writing code* which can be incorporated into **Baby Feeding Timer Project** itself.

# Contribution guidelines

1. Create an issue based on your exploration of the project files and web application. Write a comment within your issue creation and request to be assigned to the issue, stating how long it will take you to solve the issue.

2. When you are assigned to the issue, **Fork this repository (Learn how to do this)**. After forking, the URL of the project will change to:
   `https://github.com/<YourUserName>/projectname`

3. Clone the forked repository like so:
   
   `git clone 
    https://github.com/<your username>/Baby-Feeding-Timer-Project.git && cd Baby-Feeding-Timer-Project.git`
  
4. Create a branch of the repository.
    `cd project folder name`
    `git checkout -b your-new-branch-name`
  
5. Make your contribution in the branch you created. Then add all changes by using the following command:
    `git add .`

6. Commit your changes with comments about your contribution:
    `git commit -m "<message here>"`

7. Push your changes to your forked repository:
    `git push origin <add-your-branch-name>`

8. Make a pull request and wait to be notified from the creators/maintainers about your pull request and/or a merge done on your pull request.

# DO NOT ...
Make a contribution without creating an issue or going through existing issues and requesting to be assigned to an issue.
Thank you.

# Ground Rules

1. Be polite with all requests.
2. Be patient. Your requests will definitely be responded to.
3. Be polite when responding to any comment made by other contributors.
4. Avoid giving information about the project you are not sure of.
5. Call the attention of the creators/maintainers to questions and enquiries by tagging their profiles.
6. We expect all contributors to be willing to research ways to contribute to an open source project, so please do not ask questions that you can easily Google and find the answers to.
7. Please do not take feedbacks personal. A response from a creator/maintainer to review your pull request is in the best interest of the project and nothing directed at you personally as a developer/contributor. 

# Responsibilities

Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
Ensure that code language used is same as languages used in this project.
Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution?
The following resources will help you with making your first contributions

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/ and https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first ðŸ˜¸

If a creator/maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
